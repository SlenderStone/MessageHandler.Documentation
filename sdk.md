# SDK Reference

This SDK reference describes all the resources and operations available through the various MessageHandler SDKs. 

## Available SDKs

[Handler Runtime SDK](/documentation/sdk/runtime): The handler runtime SDK provides the basic components for building and hosting individual handlers. Handlers are autonomous software components that can act on specific messages.

[Fabric SDK](/documentation/sdk/fabric): The fabric SDK allows to build custom environments in which handlers can operate and communicate. The fabric will take care of handler process execution, health monitoring, scaling and so on.
